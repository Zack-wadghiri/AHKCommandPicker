/*
IDEAS:
- Save config to .properties or .config file:
	- _cpShowSelectedCommandAfterWindowCloses - Duration

- Have the GUI optional. Instead can just press CapsLock to bring up tooltip that says "Enter Command", and then user types in the tooltip instead of popping the large GUI. Could still autocomplete the command and show it in the tooltip though.
- Maybe just hide the GUI instead of actually closing it every time; this would be good for tooltip mode too, since the tooltip could show the currently selected command from the window.
- Allow user to create new simple commands easily from the GUI and save them in their own file (open file/program, path, website).
